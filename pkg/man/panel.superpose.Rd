\title{ Panel Function for Display Marked by groups }
\description{
  These are panel functions for Trellis displays useful when a grouping
  variable is specified for use within panels. The \code{x} (and
  \code{y} where appropriate) variables are plotted with different
  graphical parameters for each distinct value of the grouping variable.
}
\usage{
panel.superpose(x, y = NULL, subscripts, groups,
                panel.groups = "panel.xyplot",
                col, col.line, col.symbol,
                pch, cex, font,
                fontface, fontfamily,
                lty, lwd, alpha,
                type = "p",
                \dots,
                distribute.type = FALSE)
panel.superpose.2(\dots, distribute.type = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x,y}{ coordinates of the points to be displayed}
  \item{panel.groups}{
    the panel function to be used for each group of points. Defaults to
    \code{panel.xyplot} (behaviour in S)
  }
  \item{subscripts}{ subscripts giving indices in original data frame }
  \item{groups}{ a grouping variable. Different graphical parameters
    will be used to plot the subsets of observations given by each
    distinct value of \code{groups}. The default graphical parameters
    are obtained from \code{superpose.symbol} and \code{superpose.line}
    using \code{\link{trellis.par.get}} wherever appropriate
  }
  \item{type}{
    usually a character vector specifying what should be drawn for each
    group, passed on to the \code{panel.groups} function, which must
    know what to do with it.  By default, this is
    \code{\link{panel.xyplot}}, whose help page describes the admissible
    values.

    The functions \code{panel.superpose} and \code{panel.superpose.2}
    differ only in the default value of \code{distribute.type}, which
    controls the way the \code{type} argument is interpreted.  If
    \code{distribute.type = FALSE}, then the interpretation is the same
    as for \code{panel.xyplot} for each of the unique groups.  In other
    words, if \code{type} is a vector, all the individual components are
    honoured concurrently.  If \code{distribute.type = TRUE},
    \code{type} is replicated to be as long as the number of unique
    values in \code{groups}, and one component used for the points
    corresponding to the each different group.  Even in this case, it is
    possible to request multiple types per group, specifying \code{type}
    as a list, each component being the desired \code{type} vector for
    the corresponding group.

    If \code{distribute.type = FALSE}, any occurrence of \code{"g"} in
    \code{type} causes a grid to be drawn, and all such occurrences are
    removed before \code{type} is passed on to \code{panel.groups}.
  }
  \item{col, col.line, col.symbol, pch, cex, font, fontface, fontfamily,
    lty, lwd, alpha}{ graphical parameters, replicated to be as long as
    the number of groups, and eventually ultimately passed down to
    \code{panel.groups}.
  }
  \item{\dots}{ Extra arguments.  Passed down to \code{panel.superpose}
    from \code{panel.superpose.2}, and to \code{panel.groups} from
    \code{panel.superpose}.
  }
  \item{distribute.type}{logical controlling interpretation of the
    \code{type} argument.  
  }

}

\details{
  \code{panel.superpose} and \code{panel.superpose.2} differ essentially
  in how \code{type} is interpreted by default.  The default behaviour
  in \code{panel.superpose} is the opposite of that in S, which is the
  same as that of \code{panel.superpose.2}.
}

\seealso{
  Different functions when used as \code{panel.groups} gives different
  types of plots, for example \code{\link{panel.xyplot}},
  \code{\link{panel.dotplot}} and \code{\link{panel.linejoin}} (This can
  be used to produce interaction plots).

  See \code{\link{Lattice}} for an overview of the package.
