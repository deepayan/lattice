\details{

  All the high level lattice functions such as \code{xyplot} produce an
  object of (S3) class \code{"trellis"}, which is usually printed by its
  \code{print} method. However, the object itself can be manipulated and
  modified to a large extent using the \code{update} method, and then
  re-plotted as needed.

  Most arguments to high level functions can also be supplied to the
  \code{update} method as well, with some exceptions. Generally
  speaking, anything that would needs to change the data within each
  panel is a no-no (this includes the \code{formula, data, groups,
    subscripts} and \code{subset}). Everything else is technically game,
  though might not be implemented yet. If you find something missing
  that you wish to have, feel free to make a request.

  Not all arguments accepted by a Lattice function are processed by
  \code{update}, but the following should work (they are described in
  the help page for \code{\link{xyplot}}):

  \code{panel}, \code{aspect}, \code{as.table}, \code{between},
  \code{key}, \code{auto.key}, \code{legend}, \code{layout},
  \code{main}, \code{page}, \code{par.strip.text}, \code{prepanel},
  \code{scales}, \code{skip}, \code{strip}, \code{sub}, \code{xlab},
  \code{xlim}, \code{ylab}, \code{ylim}, \code{par.settings},
  \code{index.cond}, \code{perm.cond}

  Any other argument is added to the list of arguments to be passed to
  the \code{panel} function. Because of their somewhat special nature,
  updates to objects produced by \code{cloud} and \code{wireframe} do
  not work very well yet.

  The \code{"["} method is a convenient shortcut for updating
  \code{index.cond}.  The \code{t} method is a convenient shortcut for
  updating \code{perm.cond} in the special (but frequent) case where
  there are exactly two conditioning variables, when it has the effect
  of switching (\sQuote{transposing}) their order.

  The print method for \code{"trellis"} objects optionally saves the
  object after printing it.  If this feature is on,
  \code{trellis.last.object} can retrieve it.  Note that at most one
  object can be saved at a time.  If \code{\link{trellis.last.object}}
  is called with arguments, these are used to update the retrieved
  object before returning it.
