\title{Lattice Replacements of base graphics functions}
\description{
  These functions are intended to replace some commonly used base R
  graphics functions in panel functions.

\arguments{
  \item{ x, y, x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2, xy}{ locations. x2, y2 present
    for S compatibility
  }
  \item{length, unit}{
    determines extent of arrow head.  \code{length} specifies the length
    in terms of \code{unit}, which can be any valid grid unit as long as
    it doesn't need a \code{data} argument.  \code{unit} defaults to
    inches, which is the only option in the base version of the
    function, \code{\link{arrows}}.
  }
  \item{\dots}{
    other arguments, including ones to control graphical parameters like
    color, line type, etc. For devices that support alpha-transparency,
    a numeric argument \code{alpha} between 0 and 1 can be supplied. Be
    careful with this, since for devices that do not support
    alpha-transparency, nothing will be drawn at all if this is set to
    anything other than 0.
  }
}
\details{
  These functions are meant to be grid replacements of the corresponding
  base R graphics functions, to allow existing Trellis code to be used
  with minimal modification.  The functions \code{panel.*} are
  essentally identical to the \code{l*} versions, are recommended for
  use in new code (as opposed to ported code) as they have more readable
  names.

  See the documentation of the base functions for usage. Not all
  arguments are always supported. All these correspond to the default
  methods only. For \code{ltext}, only values 0, .5 and 1 for \code{adj}
  have any effect.
}
\note{
  There's a new \code{type="H"} option wherever appropriate, which is
  similar to \code{type="h"}, but with horizontal lines.
