Description: A powerful and elegant high-level data visualization
  system inspired by Trellis graphics, with an emphasis on
  multivariate data. Lattice is sufficient for typical graphics needs,
  and is also flexible enough to handle most nonstandard requirements.
  See ?Lattice for an introduction.
